# The CloudRunner Project
The goal of this project is to lower the cost barrier to beginning competitive robotics
and in the long term, help elevate people access robotics as a field regardless of their
socio-economic and financial background. 

CHECKING PO 
1. correct? github library link at Downloading and Installing CloudRunner Library
2. add more references for PWM and something about arduino UwU

## This repo
This repository hosts all the necessary information about the current rendition of CloudRunner and provides ad 
beginner friendly library and examples for use with the CloudRunner kit. 

## Installation and Needed Materials 
There are  3 main components needed to start utilizing the CloudRunner: 
1. Arduino IDE (version 2.x.x was used in developing this documentation)
2. CloudRunner Software Library
3. CloudRunner Kit

### Installing the Arduino IDE
First, download the Arduino IDE 2.0 which you can find in the Arduino website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  After downloading, open it and this is what you will see.

## Getting Started!
In this section, you learn the basics of robotics namely **(1) Sensor Interfacing** and **(2) Motor Actuation**

### Introduction to CloudRunner Development Board and its Important Parts

### Motor Tests

### Sensor Tests
First, go to ***File*** > ***Examples*** > ***CloudRunner*** > Click the ***sensor_array_test*** option which will show you sketches from the library you included. For the Sensor Array Test open the ‘sensor_array_test_2’.
